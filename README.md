## Dogs and Trees in Vienna and Linz

Our analysis might not provide substantial insights into the situation of dogs and trees in Vienna (opinions differ on that one). Time was sparse and internet was weak... Still, we wanted to share the final document here.

It should **not be taken too serous!!**. This does not mean that the topic itself should be considered irrelevant. Quite the opposite. I mean, who would have guessed that Vienna is dominated by Chihuahua. Now that we know this, they seem, indeed, to be everywhere... 

For any questions that surely will not arise, you can [reach out to us](mailto:austria@correlaid.org).

[Here is our Document](https://robinkohrs.github.io/open_data_22_austria/) and here is a Chihuahua!
